"...I may have been cheated on in the past, I’m not 100% sure as I’ve never really looked for it. And to be honest, I don’t feel worse for not knowing. You can spend your life worrying about perceived threats but if anything it seems to bring about the very thing you fear anyway. I hope that you can find a way to work through your insecurities and settle into the relationship"
