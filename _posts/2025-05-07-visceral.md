When I saw the pictures, it is like part of my youth died.

I am so, so, broken.

And I realized I have been broken for a long time. I thought I was fixed after I met hims.

The truth is: I always seek to be fixed by hims, to be guided and shaped for who I am. But to fix myself, I have to decide who I am going to be. Now should be the time.

Then, I can be free.
